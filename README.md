Our approach introduces a **bidirectional reasoning supervision** mechanism that leverages both *positive* and *negative rationales* to enhance financial decision-making across multiple languages. The method significantly improves interpretability, robustness, and cross-lingual generalization in financial NLP tasks.

## Codes and data will be available soon.
